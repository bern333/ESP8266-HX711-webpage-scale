# ESP8266-HX711-webpage-scale
A simple ESP8266 HX711 scale program which sends its result to a webpage.
As usual I went through lots of examples and forum answers. When I found something that worked I pared it down to the minimum. 

There are a number of HX711 libraries, several different ones helpfully labelled hx711. This one works for me, and if you put it in the same folder, it's the one the systerm will use.
