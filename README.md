# ESP8266-HX711-webpage-scale
A simple ESP8266 HX711 scale program which sends its result to a webpage.
As usual I went through lots of examples and forum answers. When I found something that worked I pared it down to the minimum. 

If you can't find it, it's because I just built it on the laptop and need to transfer it . July 31st 2020 - I'll delete this line as soon as it's done.
