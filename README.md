# ESP8266-HX711-webpage-scale
A simple ESP8266 HX711 scale program which sends its result to a webpage.
As usual I went through lots of examples and forum answers. When I found something that worked I pared it down to the minimum. 

There are a number of HX711 libraries, several helpfully labelled hx711 so you have to work out which one of the several you loaded is actually working. This one works for me.
